Usage: showterm [-e] <command to run>

showterm will record the exact output of your session, and upload it to the
internet where it can be replayed by anyone to whom you give the URL.

You can pass `-e` as the first arg and it will allow you to edit the timings
file before uploading. This can be nice if you want to take long pauses (such
as searching an answer out) in between commands.
